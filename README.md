# conversational-ui-referencing-guide

Inspired from Griffith University's [Referencing Tool](https://app.secure.griffith.edu.au/reference_tool/index.html), this web app will display reference style examples with a conversational user interface on top.

See the [conversational-ui](https://github.com/dermike/conversational-ui) repo for implementation details. The only difference is this version reads all menu structure and content data from an external json file and therefore has an extra loading dialog.

Since this repo hosts my own [live implementation](https://tools.kib.ki.se/referensguide/conversation), it will fail in most browsers because of CORS restrictions.
